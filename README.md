The computed CFD data files are quite large, so they are not included here. However, you can easily generate them yourself using the geometric models provided in the UG folder.
This is my first attempt to combine Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with Machine Learning, focusing on a 2D flow field simulation of a tablet press impeller.
Due to my limited experience, this attempt may deviate from traditional fluid dynamics principles and leans more toward an image-processing-based approach. If there are any misunderstandings or methodological issues, I sincerely welcome feedback, critiques, and discussions from experienced practitioners.

I will continue working hard to develop more interesting and practical projects in the future.
The network architecture used in this project is entirely based on the paper:

DeepCFD: Efficient Steady-State Laminar Flow Approximation with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

I am currently learning more about deep learning methods and network design.
If you find my work interesting or have suggestions for improvement, I would be very grateful for your guidance and collaboration as I continue learning in this field.
